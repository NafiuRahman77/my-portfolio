        "description": "This thesis addresses the critical issue of secret breaches in software issue reports by creating a holistic solution. It includes curating a benchmark dataset of 25,000 issue reports with 437 confirmed instances of secret breaches. The study evaluates and enhances regex-based tools to improve detection accuracy, leveraging pre-trained language models to minimize false positives. Furthermore, the project introduces SBMBot, a browser extension that provides real-time feedback to users on GitHub to prevent secret breaches during issue report creation. By combining advanced machine learning models and practical tools, the project offers a robust approach to securing open-source repositories."
